# Arduino Labs 
* Lab1 
  * You should use the serial monitor to send an up to 4 digits signed number followed by a “newline” character to signal the end of input.
  * Then, you enter another up to 4 digits signed number followed by a “newline” character.
  * The Arduino then must add these two numbers together and outputs the result in the serial monitor.
* Lab2
  * Given a stream of ‘0’s and ‘1’s (received through the serial monitor). 
  * You are required to control the arduino led to be ON iff the stream received up till now is a palindrome.
* Lab3
  * You are required to convert text (received from the serial monitor) to morse code (by blinking the LED light).
